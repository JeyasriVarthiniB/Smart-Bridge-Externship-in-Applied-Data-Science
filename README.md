# THYROID CLASSIFICATION USING DATA SCIENCE 

# ABOUT THYROID DISEASE:

The thyroid gland is a small organ that’s located in the front of the neck, wrapped around the windpipe (trachea). It’s shaped like a butterfly, smaller in the middle with two wide wings extending around your throat. The thyroid makes hormones that help control many vital functions of your body.

When the thyroid doesn’t work properly, it can impact your entire body:
• If the body makes too much thyroid hormone, it can develop hyperthyroidism. 
• If the body makes too little thyroid hormone, it’s called hypothyroidism.

Both conditions are serious and need to be treated by your healthcare provider.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW:

In this project, we have developed an efficient Thyroid Disease Classification System by comparing 6 different Classifier models' accuracy. 

The result will be one of the following: 
• hyperthyroid
• hypothyroid
• sick
• negative

# PROJECT FLOW:

	vii. Splitting the Data into X and Y
	viii. Splitting the Data into Train and Test
	ix. Handling Imbalance
	x. Applying Standard Scaler
6. Model Building (Random Forest)
7. Performing Feature Importance
8. Selecting Output Columns
9. Model Building on Selected Columns
